# Why support PEP-517

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-2" m="-t-2">



<div>

New packages don't know about setup.py, <b>pyproject.toml </b> is the new kid on the block

To keep building with only setuptools we had to inject a <b>setup.py</b> in the specfile

```bash
# create a minimal setup.py, the rest will 
# be done by setuptools
printf 'from setuptools import setup\nsetup()' > setup.py

or 

# Force setuptools_scm usage for older setuptools
sed -i 's/setuptools.setup.*/setuptools.setup(use_scm_version=True)/' setup.py
```


</div>

<div>

What's necessary to support all packages that implement PEP-517 on Pulp

- Hatch build system
- Flit build system
- Poetry build system
- And a lot of circular dependency

# How we built the support?

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-2" m="-t-2">

<div>

python-tomli is the most important package to start, since it's the TOML parser, the problem it only have support for <b> pyproject.toml </b>

We had to inject a <b>setup.py</b> for the last time

<div style="width:480px"><iframe v-click class="absolute  w-80 opacity-110" allow="fullscreen" frameBorder="0" height="200" src="https://giphy.com/embed/BkRNtZvoIywTaQT2mh/video" width="480"></iframe></div>

</div>

<div v-click>

- pipdeptree and pipgrip was heavily used to solve dependecy
- 45+ new packages added
- pyproject-rpm-macros ported from Fedora to add the necessary macros

# RPM Develop aka nightly

- Help us during branch for Katello
- Not build from one older version to one new version
  - Try to keep up to date with Pulp and branch when necessary for Katello
- Test new releases with Katello development
  - Help identifying possible regression and blockers
- Automation! Automation! Automation
  - Create one automation that can read the list of dependencies of Pulp and check if it needs <b>setup.py</b> or <b>pyproject.toml</b>
    - Use the right tool to add or update the specfile

# Building packages with COPR

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-2" m="-t-2">

<div>

Until now all RPMs got build at koji.katello.org

Maintaining our own koji demands a lot time and work

COPR Provides RHEL 8 and RHEL 9 buildroots

We can still scratch to test packages

We still use <b>obal</b> to build/scratch/lint our packages

How do we enable copr on packaging?

</div>

<div v-click>

```yaml
copr_projects:
  vars:
    core_modules:
      - 'python39:3.9'
      - 'ruby:2.7'
    rhel_9: '9'
    rhel_8: '8'
    root_repo_url: 
  hosts:
    pulpcore-copr:
      copr_project_name: 
      copr_project_chroots:
