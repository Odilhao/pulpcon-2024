# Cool Stats

* Dependabot created 62 Commits since April of 2024
  * Dependabot is now on 3rd place after **packaging@theforeman.org** that holds **183** commits against **rpm/develop**
* boto3/botocore and grpcio releases weekly and this makes **packaging@theforeman.org** stats inflated.
* We got 83 packages using **%pyproject_install** aka not tied to setup.py/cfg.

# Plans for next year

* Move packaging scratch and release out of Jenkins.
* Add Dependabot workflow to supported releases like 3.49/3.63.
* Rebuild on top of Python 3.12
* Use [Rich Dependencies](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Python/#Automatically-generated-dependencies) as much as possible
